# Portfolio-Projects
This repository is a showcase of my journey as a final-year B.Tech CSE student, featuring projects in Java, Python, and C. It includes beginner to advanced programs, problem-solving exercises, and real-world applications. I am open to internships, job opportunities, and collaborations in software development.
